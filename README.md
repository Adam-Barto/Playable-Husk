# Playable-Husk
Mod for the game Barotrauma, adding a new job class to it.

This wouldn't have been possible without referring to the code found here:
[Playable Mudraptor (Magenta Mix)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2852819097&searchtext=Mudraptor)

Made Possible thanks to:
[Barotrauma](https://github.com/Regalis11/Barotrauma) - The game itself
